# Codes for ExpandNets

> This is an anonymous code version for NeurIPS 2020 submission. Please do not distribute.

Here are codes for image classification experiments of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.
As for object detection and semantic segmentation, codes are available upon request.


Details on each experiment are listed in corresponding README.md in each folder.


## Dummy test

Here, we provide some toy code to expand a convolutional layer with either standard or 
depthwise convolutions and contract the expanded layers back.


Code in dummy_test.py is same as it in our supplementary material, which can be run simply. 

```bash
python dummy_test.py
 ```
